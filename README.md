CaptainTracker by Ugo Dos Reis

This project was masde in the summer of 2019 between High School and University. It allows Fortnite players to look at
the latest in-game news aswell as the in-game shop and the most recent tweets from the Fortnite Twitter. Other than that,
players are able to lookup the statistics of any player and go into "compare" mode to compare the stats of as many
players as they want. On top of all this, the user is able to generate images of their statistic cards, in-game news, and 
fortnite players with custom messages, to send to their friends.
